# COVID-19-Database
Due to COVID-19, Northeastern University is required to regularly test and vaccinate its
students. Since there are a very large number of students at Northeastern University, it is
necessary to create a database to store the details of each student and track each studentâ€™s
status on testing and vaccination. In addition to being able to store a large number of records,
our database can easily update and retrieve relevant details of a student. One can also perform
analytics using our database to collect various statistics. In addition, one can enhance our
database by updating and adding more tables and gaining additional insights using analytics.
